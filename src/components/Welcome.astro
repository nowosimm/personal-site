      "I graduated from The University of Cincinnati in 2023 with a major in Fashion Design and Minor in Marketing. During my last year in school I came to the realization that the path I had chosen was one I not longer saw for myself. Once graduated, I took time to reflect on the future I wanted for myself and decided I wanted to pursue programming.",

    title: "Why Front-End Development?",
    content:
      "After experimenting with both front-end and back-end programming, I decided to pursue front-end development. I found that front-end programming gave me the aspects of fashion design I really enjoyed - creating practical and aesthetic solutions, while also providing what fashion design lacked â€” advanced problem-solving and real-world application challenges.

    title: "My Journey",
    content:
      "After researching all my options, I found that The Odin Project was the best resource to get me started. I completed their beginner course and most of their JavaScript course. Along the way, I learned the basics - starting simple using the command line to writing my first <div> tags - and progressed to building full applications complete with APIs and databases. I was also lucky to have a mentor help me throughout my journey and the knowledge I received is invaluable.",
