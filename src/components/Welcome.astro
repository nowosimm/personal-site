      "After experimenting with both front-end and back-end programming, I decided to pursue front-end development. I found that front-end programming gave me the aspects of fashion design I really enjoyed - creating practical and aesthetic solutions, while also providing what fashion design lacked â€” advanced problem-solving and real-world application challenges.

      "I found that The Odin Project was the best resource to get me started. I completed their beginner course and most of their JavaScript course. Along the way, I learned the basics - starting simple using the command line to writing my first <div> tags - and progressed to building full applications complete with APIs and databases. I was also lucky to have a mentor help me throughout my journey and the knowledge I received is invaluable.",

          I am a graduate of The University Of Cincinnati where I majored in
          Fashion Design and minored in Marketing. During my final year at
          school, I realized I craved more problem solving and functional
          applications in my work then fashion design was able to give me. After
          exploring programming, I quickly fell in love with the process and
          thinking required and have been learning ever since!
