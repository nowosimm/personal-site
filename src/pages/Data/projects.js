In the routes I would then need to populate each of the schemas with the information I needed to fill out that call.",

It was a great way to mindfully think about how every action affects the next, especially when considering what it takes to win or lose each round.

Thinking ChatGPT would be of assistance, I quickly realized it was mining false information and just making a lot of stuff up, meaning I would be doing it the old-fashioned way. The next challenge I encountered was filters and sub-filters to be able to effectively sort information. It was a good challenge in thinking beyond just one layer of filtering and looking at all the possible combinations that could be sorted.",
    takeaways:
      "I always hear that using ChatGPT should be avoided, and this was the project that really confirmed that for me. When I had used it in the past, it was always on topics I was not as confident in, so being able to recognize mistakes is not as likely. It took me already knowing the correct answer and just trying to use it to be more efficient to fully understand how common it is to produce incorrect responses. ",

I found for this project it was best to start the drawing feature on mousedown and end it on mouseup.",
